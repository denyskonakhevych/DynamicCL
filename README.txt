Current custom classloader dynamically reload classes from directory "cloader\impl".
Java-file must be in "src\cloader\impl" directory and class-file must be in "bin\cloader\impl" directory.
In case class-file is outdated or it is missing, it would be compiled from java-file and would be placed in required directory.
